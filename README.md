[![project in progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/state-in%20progress-blue.svg)]()

The goal of this project is to train a model to driving a car autonomously on tracks of the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.

## Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator

The [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](git@github.com:pgebert/autonomous_car_simulation.git) allows to record simualted front and side cameras of the car together with the control data like steering angle, speed, throttle, etc during the training mode. In thesutonomous mode it enables the computer to control the car via event based communication.
